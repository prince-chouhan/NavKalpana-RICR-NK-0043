=== TASK ===
You are an expert fitness coach with complete knowledge of this user's history. Generate a personalized weekly workout plan for Week ${weekNumber}.

ANALYZE THE USER'S DATA:
1. Look at their progress trend - are they improving or plateauing?
2. Check their adherence rates - do they need easier or harder workouts?
3. Review their fatigue levels - do they need more recovery?
4. Consider their goal and current progress toward it
5. Account for their experience level and training days per week: ${userContext.profile.training_days_per_week || userContext.profile.available_days_per_week || 4} days
6. CRITICAL: Check INJURIES/LIMITATIONS - AVOID exercises that could aggravate: ${userContext.profile.injuries_limitations && userContext.profile.injuries_limitations.length > 0 ? userContext.profile.injuries_limitations.join(', ') : 'None'}
7. IMPORTANT: Check their GOAL TIMELINE - they need to reach their target in ${userContext.timeline ? userContext.timeline.timeline.optimal_weeks + ' weeks' : 'their planned timeframe'}
8. Adjust workout intensity to match their timeline - if behind schedule, increase intensity; if ahead, maintain current pace

=== PROGRESSIVE ADAPTATION RULES ===
${userContext.workout_history && userContext.workout_history.length > 0 ? `
PREVIOUS WORKOUT ANALYSIS:
${userContext.workout_history.slice(-2).map(w => `
Week ${w.week}: Used ${w.exercises_used.length} exercises including: ${w.exercises_used.slice(0, 5).map(e => `${e.name} (${e.sets}x${e.reps})`).join(', ')}
`).join('')}

CRITICAL PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS FOR WEEK ${weekNumber}:

1. EXERCISE VARIETY (MANDATORY - 40-50% NEW EXERCISES):
   - You MUST change at least 5-6 exercises from the previous week
   - Keep only 2-3 core compound movements (e.g., Bench Press, Squats, Deadlifts)
   - Replace other exercises with variations:
     * If Week 1 had "Barbell Bench Press", try "Dumbbell Bench Press" or "Push-ups"
     * If Week 1 had "Barbell Rows", try "Dumbbell Rows" or "Cable Rows"
     * If Week 1 had "Squats", try "Goblet Squats", "Bulgarian Split Squats", or "Leg Press"
     * If Week 1 had "Tricep Pushdown", try "Overhead Tricep Extension" or "Dips"
   - Rotate equipment: Barbell → Dumbbell → Cable → Bodyweight → Machines
   
2. VOLUME PROGRESSION (if adherence ≥ 80%):
   - Increase reps by 2-3 per set (e.g., 8-10 → 10-12 → 12-15)
   - OR add 1 more set to key exercises (e.g., 3 sets → 4 sets)
   - Example: Week 1 had "3x8-10", Week 2 should have "3x10-12" or "4x8-10"
   
3. INTENSITY PROGRESSION:
   - For Weight Loss: Increase reps to 12-15 range, reduce rest time by 10-15 seconds
   - For Muscle Gain: Keep reps in 6-10 range, suggest heavier weights in guidance
   - For Body Recomposition: Mix of 6-8 reps (strength) and 10-12 reps (hypertrophy)
   - For Endurance: Increase reps to 15-20, add circuit-style training
   
4. SMART SUBSTITUTIONS (EXAMPLES):
   - Chest: Barbell Bench → Dumbbell Bench → Cable Flyes → Push-ups
   - Back: Barbell Rows → Dumbbell Rows → Cable Rows → Pull-ups
   - Legs: Barbell Squats → Goblet Squats → Bulgarian Split Squats → Leg Press
   - Shoulders: Overhead Press → Dumbbell Shoulder Press → Lateral Raises → Face Pulls
   - Arms: Barbell Curls → Dumbbell Curls → Hammer Curls → Cable Curls
   
5. GOAL-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS:
   - Weight Loss: More compound movements, shorter rest (60s), higher reps (12-15)
   - Muscle Gain: Progressive overload focus, moderate reps (6-10), longer rest (90-120s)
   - Body Recomposition: Mix of strength (6-8 reps) and hypertrophy (10-12 reps)
   - Endurance: Higher reps (15-20), circuit-style training, minimal rest (30-45s)

REMEMBER: You MUST introduce at least 40-50% new exercises while keeping 2-3 core movements. This is essential for preventing plateaus and keeping workouts engaging.
